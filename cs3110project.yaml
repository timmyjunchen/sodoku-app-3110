  Our project is an interactive sudoku board. It supports multiple difficulties 
  (easy, medium, hard) and board sizes (4x4, 9x9, 16x16). Through the CLI, 
  users can select the cell they wish to fill and the number with which to fill
  it. If users are stuck, they can call for a hint which will provide the next
  step for solving the board. For users that want the boars solved, they can 
  manually input a board or load one from the local filesystem to be solved.
