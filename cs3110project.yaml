  Our project is an interactive sudoku board. It supports multiple difficulties 
  (easy, medium, hard) which are auto generated randomly 
  and will have a working interface where users can select
  the cell they wish to fill. There is also a hint feature in case users are
  stuck which will provide clues about which cells/numbers to focus on. There 
  will also be a solver in case people want to see the solution or input their 
  own boards.
